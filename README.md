""Summary of research findings"": The literature review most likely revealed a paucity of detailed studies on the practical consequences of privacy-preserving machine learning models in the context of homomorphic encryption. This study not only investigates these models, but also evaluates their performance measures in the encrypted domain, such as precision scores and R^2 score. This empirical review adds essential insights that were likely absent in the previous literature, filling the gap by presenting practical findings on the applicability and limitations of privacy-preserving machine learning models using homomorphic encryption. It gives a thorough analysis of the performance of privacy-preserving machine learning models in the context of homomorphic encryption. The decision tree model stood out as a top performer, demonstrating both flexibility and accuracy in the encrypted domain. Notably, it obtained a precision score of 0.97, indicating its ability to make precise predictions. Furthermore, the decision tree model achieved a near approximation to unambiguous predictions, demonstrating its strong capabilities.The support vector machine also provided an important contribution, demonstrating high accuracy in the homomorphically encrypted environment. This makes the support vector machine an attractive choice for safe machine learning applications where maintaining data privacy is critical. In essence, the study's findings highlight the efficacy of these privacy-preserving models in achieving high levels of accuracy while operating within the constraints of homomorphic encryption, opening up promising avenues for the integration of secure machine learning practices in sensitive data environments.
